            <img src="images/profile.webp" alt="Luis Antonio Olivares in nature" loading="lazy">
            <p>Hello! My name is Luis Antonio Olivares. I currently live in Guadalajara, Mexico, where I've been for the past six years. I'm originally from the United States and grew up in the beautiful states of Idaho and Washington.</p>
            <p>Both Idaho and Washington are rich in natural beautyâ€”forests, lakes, rivers, and mountains. Because of that, I've always been passionate about the outdoors. I enjoy fishing, hiking, floating down rivers, camping, and just about anything that connects me to nature.</p>

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I originally come from a business background. However, after moving to Mexico, I found a new pathâ€”tutoring children from around the world. My students come from a wide range of cultural backgrounds, including:</p>

        <div class="background-grid">
        <ul>
            <li>Japan</li>
            <li>Mexico</li>
            <li>South Korea</li>
            <li>Thailand</li>
            <li>China</li>
            <li>France</li>
            <li>Belgium</li>
            <li>Turkey</li>
        </ul>

        </div>
        <p>I learn just as much from them as they do from me, and that's what makes teaching such a rewarding experience!</p>

            <h2>Teaching Style</h2>
            <div class="teachingstyle-image">

            <p>I believe that connection and fun are essential parts of the learning processâ€”especially for young students. When students laugh and enjoy the lesson, they are more focused, more confident, and better able to retain what they learn.</p>
            <p>My lessons are highly personalized. I adapt my teaching materials to match each studentâ€™s interests, creating a guided learning path that keeps them engaged and motivated. Itâ€™s always a joy to see students understand and respond to questions using proper grammar.</p>
            <p>Once they build confidence in speaking, I increase the level of fluency to help develop their listening skills as well. Ultimately, my goal is to help every student express themselves clearly and confidently in Englishâ€”because thatâ€™s the reason they chose to learn the language in the first place.</p>
